\title{Plot resulting statistics for knn space-time disaggregation}
\usage{
\method{plot}{knnst}(x, site = "S1", base_units = NULL,
  breaks = "Sturges", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object inheriting from class \code{knnst}}

\item{site}{The site to plot. Site name as a character.}

\item{base_units}{The (input) units of the flow that was disaggregated. These
units will be shown as the y-axis label of the plot.}

\item{breaks}{Specifies how breaks are computed for histograms. See \code{\link[=hist]{hist()}}.}

\item{...}{arguments to be passed to subsequent methods.}
}
\description{
\code{plot.knnst()} implements the \code{\link[=plot]{plot()}} method for \code{knnst} objects, and relies on
ggplot2. It plots the key statistics the knn space-time disaggregation method
should be preserving.
}
\details{
\code{...} is passed to \code{\link[=geom_point]{geom_point()}} and \code{\link[=labs]{labs()}}.
